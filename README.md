# List Technologies with Java

Create a new Java application that will list at least 8 programming technologies or skills that you know.

1. Create a new class named `MyCodingSKills`. Remember it must be in a `.java` file of the same name.
2. Within it, create a `main` method
3. Within the `main()` method, call `System.out.println()` at least 8 times. Each time, print one programming technology you know and understand.
4. Compile the program. If you have no errors, then run the program. Admire your output!
